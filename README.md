# Questify
Questify is a 'q&amp;a' based game. it is planned as a demo iOS application to challenge socket programing principals by importing Soket.io library.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get my application up and running. However, i am too lazy to fill this :blush: realy i dont have enoght time to document everything, yet.
